## Critical Security Risk Assessment üö®

### **CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

#### 1. **API Key Exposure in Repository** - SEVERITY: CRITICAL
- **Finding**: Live Google API key `AIza****[REDACTED]****` found in environment configuration
- **Impact**: Unauthorized API access, potential billing fraud, service abuse
- **Action**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **REVOKE KEY IMMEDIATELY** and implement proper secret management

#### 2. **Authentication Bypass in Development** - SEVERITY: HIGH
- **Finding**: Complete authentication bypass in development mode
- **Code**: `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') return next();`
- **Impact**: Unrestricted access to all endpoints and data

#### 3. **Frontend API Key Transmission** - SEVERITY: HIGH
- **Finding**: API keys stored in localStorage and transmitted to backend
- **Impact**: Keys accessible to malicious JavaScript, visible in network logs
- **Action**: Implement backend-only API key management

### Security Risk Summary:
- **Critical**: 1 vulnerability
- **High**: 2 vulnerabilities  
- **Medium**: 5 vulnerabilities
